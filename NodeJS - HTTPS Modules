Node.js Essentials - HTTPS modules - Get the wiki page

Use HTTPS modules to make request to https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Nodejs and 
write the source code of the page into "Node.html".

 
Note:  The Node.html file should be created only when the contents are getting written into it.

 
Steps to do hands-on:

1. Write your code in App.js
2. You can run your application by executing "node App.js" command.
3. You can test your app by clicking "Run Test Cases" button (or) Open terminal, go to /home/project folder, type the command “bash score.sh”.


var https = require("https");
var fs = require("fs");

//Write your code here
// https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki/Nodejs

var writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('Node.html');

const options = {
    hostname: 'en.wikipedia.org',
    port: 443,
    path: '/wiki/Nodejs',
    method: 'GET',
};

const req = https.request(options, res => {
    res.on('data', d => {
        writeStream.write(d, 'UTF8');
    });
});

writeStream.on('finish', () => {
    writeStream.end();
});

req.end();
